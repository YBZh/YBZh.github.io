I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), advised by [Prof. Lei Zhang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=tAK5l1IAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 
I received my Bachelorâ€™s and Master's degrees in [South China University of Technology](http://www.scut.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Kui Jia](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Mf9VHRcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
Now I also work as a Research Intern in DAMO Academy, Alibaba.


My current research interests include transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, and computer vision. 
More specifically, I am working on the problem of domain adaptation. I also have experiences on few-shot learning and fine-grained visual categorization.
